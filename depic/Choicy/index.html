		<h2 role="header">Description</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>An advanced tweak configurator!<br><br>

					NOT A JAILBREAK DETECTION BYPASS<br><br>

					Features:<br>
					• Disable tweak injection for every process individually<br>
					• Configure each tweak dylib for every process individually<br>
					• Disable tweaks globally (with the ability to set exceptions for individual processes)<br>
					• Option for an application shortcut to launch the application with or without tweaks once
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 role="header">Compatibility</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>iOS 10 - 14</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 role="header">What's new? (1.4)</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				• Black- and Whitelist Overwrites inside Global Tweak Configuration have been replaced with a process specific "Overwrite Global Configuration" setting (If whitelist / blacklist overwrites were enabled previously, all processes configured with whitelist / blacklist configurations will automatically have this setting enabled)<br>
				• Rename "Whitelist" and "Blacklist" to "Allow" and "Deny" for improved legibility and better localization<br>
				• Add the ability to configure the plugins of an app (widgets, notification extensions, etc.) through a new "App Plugins" section accessible at the bottom of the process configuration of an app<br>
				• Add a "Tweak Troubleshooting" section to the root preference page, this can be used to automatically detect if Choicy is preventing tweaks from a selected package from injecting, it also includes an option to automatically resolve it if that's determined to be the case<br>
				• Add an "Additional Executables" section to the root preference page, this allows for power users to configure tweak injection for any binary on the filesystem<br>
				• Add an API inside SpringBoard that allows for other tweaks to provide overrides for app tweak configurations (excludes daemons and other non-app processes)<br>
				• In cases were Choicy does not load first and some tweaks are greyed out, an info button now appears at the end of the tweak list, informing the user of the problem and possible solutions when tapped<br>
				• Make it possible to search by app identifier inside the search bar of the app list<br>
				• Add a "Reset Preferences" button to the bottom of the root preference page<br>
				• Fix a bug where the "Custom Tweak Configuration" option could in some cases be incorrectly greyed out after minimizing and re-opening the preferences app<br>
				• Large parts of the codebase have been refactored and/or rewritten
